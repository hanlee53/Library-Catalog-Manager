# Library-Catalog-Manager
This Java code was written in the Objet-Oriented Programming II course during my studies in Concordia University. The program is designed to gather input from multiple specified text files that hold details about various books. It categorizes the books by their genres and enables users to easily identify and eliminate invalid books/records. The key principles utilized in the program include Java exception handling, File I/O, and fundamental object-oriented programming concepts. In order to fully functionate the program from the source codes, an appropriate modification to user files path in "classPart1" may be required.
